The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce colour, in the ornaments of his dress. Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish colour. In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment. Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.
