When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, 'You may not do so.' The disciples did bury him in great style. The Master said, 'Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.'
