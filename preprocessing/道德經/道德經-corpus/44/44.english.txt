1.    Or fame or life,      Which do you hold more dear?    Or life or wealth,      To which would you adhere?    Keep life and lose those other things;    Keep them and lose your life:â€”which brings      Sorrow and pain more near? 2.    Thus we may see,      Who cleaves to fame      Rejects what is more great;    Who loves large stores      Gives up the richer state. 3.    Who is content    Needs fear no shame.    Who knows to stop    Incurs no blame.    From danger free    Long live shall he.
